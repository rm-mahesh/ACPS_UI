    <meta name="description" content="L2MRail has developed an innovative Wheel Impact Load Detection (F-WILD) system in partnership with RDSO, Indian Railway, Government of India. Our F-WILD system captures the wheel signature as a train moves over the instrumented zone of the track and processes data in real-time. The processed information is stored in secured servers (private cloud) for all authorized persons to view through a customized GUI. Information on the critically damaged wheels is communicated through messages to designated authorities. Our solution enables the Railway companies to monitor the health of all rail wheels that pass over the ‘WILD-zone’ and assists in condition-based maintenance of rolling stock, thereby reducing the maintenance costs while improving the rolling stock life cycle.">
