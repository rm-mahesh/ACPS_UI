      content="L2MRail has developed an innovative Wheel Impact Load Detection (F-WILD) system in partnership with RDSO, Indian Railway, Government of India. Our F-WILD system captures the wheel signature as a train moves over the instrumented zone of the track and processes data in real-time. The processed information is stored in secured servers (private cloud) for all authorized persons to view through a customized GUI. Information on the critically damaged wheels is communicated through messages to designated authorities. Our solution enables the Railway companies to monitor the health of all rail wheels that pass over the ‘WILD-zone’ and assists in condition-based maintenance of rolling stock, thereby reducing the maintenance costs while improving the rolling stock life cycle."

        <h2>ACPS (Axle Counter Plus)</h2>
        <p><strong>The Axle Counter Plus (ACPS)</strong> counts the number of train axles and provides information about track section occupancy. This technology utilizes <strong>Bragg Grating optical sensors</strong>, which offer highly reliable axle counts and section status updates.

        <h2>Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) Sensors</h2>
        <p>FBG sensors are optical sensors that utilize light reflection within optical fibers to detect changes in physical parameters such as strain, temperature, and pressure. These sensors have a periodic variation in the refractive index along the fiber core, which reflects a specific wavelength of light, called the <strong>Bragg wavelength</strong>, while allowing other wavelengths to pass. When external forces (strain or temperature changes) are applied, the spacing of the grating and the refractive index change, shifting the reflected wavelength.
